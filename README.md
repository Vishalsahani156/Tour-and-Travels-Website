📦 Backend Project
This is a backend API built using Node.js and Express.js, with authentication, media uploads, and database storage. It leverages MongoDB for data persistence, Cloudinary for file storage, and Multer for file handling.


🚀 Features
User authentication with hashed passwords using bcrypt

RESTful API built with Express.js

File uploads using Multer

Cloud-based media storage using Cloudinary

Real-time backend monitoring with Nodemon

Data modeling and interaction with MongoDB using Mongoose


🧰 Tech Stack
Node.js – JavaScript runtime

Express.js – Web framework for Node.js

MongoDB – NoSQL database

Mongoose – MongoDB ODM for schema modeling

Bcrypt – Password hashing

Multer – Middleware for handling multipart/form-data

Cloudinary – Cloud-based image and video management

Nodemon – Development server auto-reloader

🔐 Authentication
This project uses bcrypt to hash passwords before saving them in the database. JWT or session-based authentication can be added for securing routes.


📦 File Uploads
Files are uploaded via Multer.

Media files are stored securely in Cloudinary.

🗃️ Database
MongoDB is used for storing users and other resources.

Mongoose provides schema validation and query building.
